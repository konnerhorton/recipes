## Welcome

This is meant to be a quick solution to a recipe sharing problem. Some imrpovements (hopefully) coming in the future:

- Better cataloging so it's easier to "discover" recipes.
- Impelement (somehow) with [cooklang](https://cooklang.org/) language so that recipes can be interacted with more effectively.
  - This might require turning this into a WASM.

For now, use the tags below to provide some minimally useful recipe selection.
