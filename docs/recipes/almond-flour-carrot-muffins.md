# Almond-flour Carrot Muffins

## Notes

- I use (what I think is) a baby-food freezer tray. It has 1-oz "muffin" compartments and I fill them to the brim (so probably ~1.25 oz each), this makes ~20+ muffins with that.
- Typically use a granular sugar substitute like those labeled as monk-fruit extract (and typically have erythritol as well).

## Ingredients

- 1.5 cup almond flour (8 oz)
- 1.5 tsp baking powder
- 0.125 teaspoon salt
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 0.5 tsp nutmeg
- 2 tsp lemon zest
- 4 eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 cups grated carrots (10 oz)
- 0.5 cup sugar

## Preparation

1. Preheat oven to 350 deg F and grease muffin tin.
1. Combine everything except the almond flour in a blender and blend until smooth.
1. Add almond flour to mixing bowl, then add contents from blender and mix well with saptula.
1. Place in muffin tin and cook for 25 minutes. Remove and let cool.
