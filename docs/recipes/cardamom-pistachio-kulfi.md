# Cardamom-Pistachio Kulfi

## Ingredients

- 1 gal milk
- 2 cans (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk
- 1 tbsp cardamom
- 1 cup pistachios (chopped)
- 0.5 tsp salt

## Preparation

1. Heat milk in large pot and add sweetened condensed milk.
1. Keep the temperature low (so that the milk doesn't burn).
1. Frequently (or constantly) stir and scrape the sides.
1. Cook until the liquid is reduced to half the quantity (it will be pretty thick).
1. Remove from heat and add salt, cardamom, and pistachios.
1. Let the mixture cool a bit and pour it into your choice of container (sheet-cake pan, popsicle sticks, ice-cube trays, small cups, etc.)
1. Place in freezer until frozen solid and serve.
