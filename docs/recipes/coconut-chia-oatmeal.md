# Coconut Chia Oatmeal

_We mostly use this when traveling for a quick cooking breakfast or snack_

## Ingredients

- 1 oz rolled oats
- 0.5 oz chia seeds
- 0.5 oz coconut milk powder
- 0.5 oz coconut flakes
- 1 oz sliced almonds
- 0.7 oz raisins
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 pinch cinnamon

## Preparation

1. Combine all ingredients together.
2. Put in heat resistant container and pour in boiling water.
3. Let steep until desired tenderness.

## Notes
- Substitute almonds and raisins for other fruits and nuts as desired.
- Coconut milk powder can be hard to find. My brick-and-mortar source is a Thai grocery store, but it has some sucralose added, so not ideal.
