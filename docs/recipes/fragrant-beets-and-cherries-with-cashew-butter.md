# Fragrant Beets and Cherries with Cashew Butter

## Ingredients

- 1-1/2 pound red beets
- 3/4 cup red wine vinegar
- 1/3 cup olive oil
- 1/3 cup dried chamomile flowers
- 1/3 cup dried hibiscus flowers
- 2 tbsp kosher salt
- 1/2 cup cashew butter
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1/2 pound cherries, pitted and halved
- 1/2 cup chopped roasted cashews
- 1/2 cup mint leaves
- flaky sea salt
- black pepper

## Preparation

1. Pre-heat oven to 375 deg F.
1. Place beets in a dish just big enough to fit them.
1. Mix red wine vinegar, olive oil, kosher salt, chamomile, and hibiscus.
1. Pour liquid mixture over the beets into their dish.
1. Cover beets with parchment paper and foil, seal tightly around lip of the dish.
1. Place dish in the oven.
1. After an hour, check for doneness (it usually takes a while).
1. If not done, add water (if needed), reseal, and place back in oven. Check again every 20 minutes until done.
1. When done, remove from oven and rotate beets face down into the liquid (upside down from how they cooked) and let cool. If you're in a hurry, you can dump the beets in ice-water to cool them.
1. Using your hands, peel the beets and rip them into bite-sized chunks, place in a bowl and set aside.
1. Combine cashew butter, 1/2 tsp of salt, lemon juice, and 2 tbsp water; mix thoroughly, add water until it is easily spreadable.
1. Spread cashew butter on a serving platters, then top with beets.
1. Sprinkle with some lemon juice and olive oil.
1. Top with roasted cashews, sea salt, ground pepper, and mint.

## Notes

- The first few times I did this I used dried cherries instead of fresh and it turned out really good.
    - If you do this, I recommend using ~half the stated mass (dried cherries are much lighter). 
- Substitute cashew butter and/or roasted cashews for other nut butters and/or nuts as needed.
    - Sunflower butter and roasted pistachios is a good combination.
