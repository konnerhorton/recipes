# Stir Fried Okra

## Notes

- This needs a wok with very high heat to work right, otherwise it just gets a little soggy.
- When done right, the okra has none of the gooeyness that frequently turns people off.

## Ingredients

- 1 lbs okra
- 1 tbsp oil
- fish sauce

## Preparation

1. Clean and cut okra to 3/4 in long peices.
2. Heat oil in wok over low heat.
3. Once the oil it hot, turn heat to very high and add okra.
4. Stir fry okra until the peices start to char a bit on the outside.
5. Remove from heat and add fish sauce to taste.
