# Stir Fried Thai Basil

## Ingredients

- 500 g ground pork
- 1 tbsp cooking oil
- 100 g thai basil (whole leaves)
- 2 ea thai chilis
- 8 ea garlic cloves (chopped)
- fish sauce

## Preparation

1. Heat wok on low and add oil, then add pork and cook until just done.
2. Move pork to the side of the wok, as high as you can (to keep away from the heat), some liquid (fat and water) should pool in the center of the wok.
3. Add garlic and chilis to the fluid in the center and let cook on low for a while, let it get a little soft and develop a good fragrance. During this time, the pork should get a little crispy with a few brown crunchy bits on it.
4. Turn the heat up very high and quickly mix the pork and garlic.
5. Once mixed, add the thai basil and contingue to stirfry until the leaves are just wilted.
6. Remove from heat and place in bowl, add fish sauce to taste.

## Notes

- This is better with hot / holy basil, but it's harder to find. We can reliably source thai basil.
- Best done in a wok.
- Where we buy thai basil, it comes in 100 gram portions of stalks and leaves. It's about 1/2 leaves by weight. The 100 grams above is for just the leaves.
