# Sweet Sticky Rice

For desserts like [grilled bananas with coconut cream and turmeric](grilled-bananas-with-coconut-sticky-rice.md) or mango sticky rice.

## Ingredients

### Rice

- 2 cups dry sticky rice (sometimes called sweet of glutinous rice)

### Sauce

- 2 cups coconut milk
- 0.25 cups sugar
- 2 tbsp palm sugar
- 1 tsp salt

## Preparation

1. Soak sticky rice overnight (can do quicker, but at least 2 hours).
1. Steam in a cheesecloth (can be with a traditional sticky rice steamer, but I've had plenty of success with the stainless-steel western steamers).
1. While rice is cooking, mix the sauce ingredients and simmer until sugar is dissolved.
1. When rice is complete, put in a dish just big enough to hold it and pour warm sauce over it. Allow to soak for a bit before serving.

## Notes

1. This is a much less sweet version of the one from the source below. It uses 1/6th the sugar of the original, but I think it is still sufficiently sweet.
