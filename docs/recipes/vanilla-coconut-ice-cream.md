# Vanilla Coconut Ice Cream

## Ingredients

- 1.75 cup coconut milk
- 1.75 cup coconut cream
- 0.25 cup liquid sweetner
- 0.75 cup sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 0.5 tsp salt

## Preparation
1. Combine everything except vanilla in a sauce pan on medium heat and bring to a simmer (be sure to stir so nothing burns).
2. Blend the mixture (wither traditional or immersion blender is fine).
3. Mix in vanilla extract and pour into an airtight container, put in refrigerator for at least 4 hours.
4. Once chilled, churn in ice cream maker.
5. Once the ice cream is done, you can eat immediately (for a much softer ice cream) or put in an air tight container in the freezer for at least 5 hours to stiffen.

## Notes

- For the liquid sweetner, the original recipe calls for light corn syrup, we usually use either honey or maple syrup.
